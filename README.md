This is a ConvDAE using in notMNIST dataset.

The ConvDAE you can see in https://github.com/NELSONZHAO/zhihu/tree/master/denoise_auto_encoder.            
The difference is the loss function, we use the l2_loss, not the sigmoid_cross_entropy.


And the notMNIST dataset you can find in https://github.com/hankcs/udacity-deep-learning.
